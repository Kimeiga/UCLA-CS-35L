File - log.txt - A file to describe each command I used in the lab and the
reasons as to why I used them.

For this lab my partner acting as the client/server was Omar Ozgur.
To start this lab we boot up Ubuntu from a disk image loaded onto a usb.
We do this so that we can set up a server on our own machines as trying to
do so on the SEASNet lab will fail as we do not have root access.

We start by making sure we have all the openssh files we need by typing
the following commands:

dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

Noticing that we're missing the server package, we download it with the
following command:

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

I started by being the server and setting up Omar as the client with the
following set of commands:

ssh-keygen

This command essentially generates and authenticates RSA keys for SSH 
connection 2 for when someone tries to ssh into the server's I host.
I set no password for this key.

sudo useradd -d /home/omar/ -m omar

This creates a directory named omar within the home directory and adds the
user with username omar.

sudo passwd omar

This creates the password for the user omar, I chose to set the password as
omar as well for convenience.

cd /home/omar

We enter omar's directory and create an ssh directory to store all the 
information from the RSA keys (public and private) to the hosts. We then
continue to make the owner omar so that he is able to log into the server
and add any files/directories he may want to. The following commands were
used for this setup.

sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R omar .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

We then grab the IP address with the following command for omar to use it to
log in to my server.

ifconfig

192.232.123.73

After he has logged in (using similar commands as listed below for when I log
into his server), we test it out by creating files on each others local
computers and checking to see that we both can see it, which works.

I then proceed to behave as a client. After Omar sets up his server, we use
ifconfig to get the IP address and then I type in the following command:

ssh-copy-id -i jahan@169.232.123.100

This basically adds my public key to the ssh folder within the server.

ssh-add

This command in tandem with ssh-agent essentially adds the password required
to log into the server within the ssh folder so that I never have to type
in the password again to log into the server.

ssh jahan@169.232.123.100

Enter the server with the IP address that I got from Omar's ifconfig.

touch hello_omar.txt

Add a file to see if it both him and I can see it on the server and indeed
we can.

ssh -X jahan@169.232.123.100

Log in with the capability to open other programs such as Firefox as tested out
below.
