File - gitk-decription.txt - A description of what we see in the gitk window
starting from the top left corner going in a clockwise fashion:

We see a window with the history of the commits in a tree like structure
with their commit messages. This shows the structure of the repository
with the position of the HEAD pointer and the different branches.

We then see a list of the authors of the respective commits and their emails.

Then a list of all the dates of the commits that we're looking at.

Below this is the files that are impacted by the selected commit.

To the left of this from bottom up we first see the file changes in diff
format, above which lies more information about the selected commit with 
the name of the committer, email, parent, child, branches and the commit
message. Finally just above this subwindow and below the tree structure
we have the SHA1 ID of the commit.
