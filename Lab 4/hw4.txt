File - hw4.txt - A description of what I did throughout the homework, stating
the commands I ran with the reasons as to why I ran these commands with respect
to the specification.

We start by checking out of the v3.0 directory while creating a new branch
with the following command:
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

We then apply the patch that we generated from the lab to this new branch
in order to remove all the grave accents with the following commands:
patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

We use git status to confirm the six C files that are changed and we go
through all six files using emacs and then using C-x 4 a to create a 
Changelog for that file and add the relevant messages.
We then add this and then commit with the Changelog as follows:

git add .
git commit -F Changelog

We then generate a formatted patch that we use with our partners to make 
sure the patches work on different systems. My partner was Omar Ozgur.
We gnerate the patch as follows:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

We then checkout from the quote branch and then go into a new branch with
the same stuff called partner:

git checkout v3.0 -b partner

We then scp from the server to get the file and then send it to my partner
and download my partner's patch to my server and then run the following
command:

git am < ../partner-patch.txt

And then run git log to see if my partners patch is applied and get the
following output:

        * src/util.c: Changed grave accents to apostrophes

        * src/sdiff.c: Changed grave accents to apostrophes

        * src/dir.c: Changed grave accents to apostrophes

        * src/diff3.c: Changed grave accents to apostrophes

        * src/diff.c: Changed grave accents to apostrophes

        * src/cmp.c: Changed grave accents to apostrophes

We then run the general commands as in the lab but using partners patch:
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
make distdir

This creates a directory diffutils-3.0.1-63d7 that contains my partners 
patch and we view the Changelog in this new directory and get the same 
output as the log confirming partners patch as successful.

We then download X-11 for the mac and then use remote desktop connection
to run gitk within the downloaded emacs folder. We
