File: hw3.txt - Answers to the questions defined in the specification.

1.) We notice that the line case_long_iso_time_style: because of two reasons.
The first is that this line is repeated twice, and the second is that its
a goto statement in a switch statement. Because it is part of a switch 
statement, it was not necessary to remove it as it would have just
fallen through to the second case_long_iso_time_style: but it was an attempt
to clean up messy code.

2.) The new patched version of the coreutils-7.6 assumes the reader is
accustomed to reading the date in English, which may not be the case if my
company was to be working with international clients/colleagues and so may
create an aura of confusion due to the timestamp format. The issue also arises
that if there were programs written specific to a timestamp format - namely
the non patched version - then the patch may produce undesirable results when
running these programs.

3.) The file /dev/null is basically an empty file. Since the randline.py
script tries to read from the file and index the elements in the file,
it assumes the file has something in it. Thus when running the command:
python randline.py /dev/null we get the following:
File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.10/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 275, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
    empty
    IndexError: list index out of range
Because the seq is empty we get the index error.

4.) Python3 deprecated automatic tuple unpacking, and so the parameter
(errno, strerror) passed in an exception gives an error as this is a tuple.
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

A fix for this would be to pass in a single parameter instead and then 
reference the multiple arguments.
