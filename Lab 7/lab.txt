File - lab.txt - A file describing the steps taken in the lab and the reasons
behind them.

We created two programs to mimic the tr command with two parameters 'from' and
'to' while taking in input from stdin. The difference between the programs are
one uses getchar and putchar using buffered I/O while tr2u uses read and write
using direct syscalls.

The programs were written almost exactly the same, using the same error checks 
to make sure the number of arguments are only from and to, from doesnt have
duplicates and from and to have the same length.

We then simply use getchar/read to take in one byte at a time compare it
to any of the characters in our from array and if so, putchar/write the 
corresponding to character, else just write the normal character. This 
effectively does a transliteration.

We then run strace and time on two conditions for these programs to test their
relative efficiencies.
We use the following command to produce a file that is atleast 5 MB as defined
by the spec for testing purposes:
dd if=/dev/urandom of=reallybig.txt bs=1M count=5

We start with running the strace command for copying one file to another, and
use wc -l to get an approximate number of syscalls made from the output file
we put the strace output into. 

strace -o strace_output0 ./tr2b abc def < reallybig.txt > bufCop.txt
wc -l gives us 31 lines which is close to 31 syscalls made by the buffered
program while copying from one file to another.

strace -o strace_output1 ./tr2u abc def < reallybig.txt > unbufCop.txt
wc -l gives us 10485786 lines which is significantly more syscalls we see
being made. This is because for each byte there are two syscalls made using 
read and write, but with getchar and putchar, the information is stored
in a buffer and then fewer syscalls are made fewer times.

strace -o strace_output2 ./tr2b abc def < reallybig.txt
wc -l gives us 33 syscalls approximately for copying directly to the terminal
and printing out to stdout, using getchar and putchar

strace -o strace_output3 ./tr2u abc def < reallybig.txt
wc -l gives us 10485793 syscalls approximately for copying to the terminal
using read and write.

We notice that once again the buffered version makes far fewer syscalls to 
the unbuffered version for the same reasons - the buffer I/O. But we notice
that the number of syscalls when copying to the terminal is more than the
corresponding command for just copying because now the program needs the
ability to print to the screen for which it needs access to the I/O
devices which require more syscalls.

We then test efficiency using the time command under the same conditions as
before - copying from one file to another and then copying to the terminal.
The commands and their results are given below:

time ./tr2b abc def < reallybig.txt > bufCop.txt
real	0m0.004s
user	0m0.001s
sys		0m0.000s

time ./tr2u abc def < reallybig.txt > unbufCop.txt
real	0m6.035s
user	0m0.371s
sys		0m5.589s

time ./tr2b abc def < reallybig.txt
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys		0m0.001s

time ./tr2u abc def < reallybig.txt
seal	0m10.804s
user	0m0.392s
sys		0m5.467s


The conclusion we can make is that getchar and putchar are significantly
faster than read and write because of the use of buffers to perform 
fewer syscalls; and that writing to the stdout (copying to terminal) is
slightly longer as it reqiures a few more syscalls.
